# You can specify a static bindings for two-way mode (when the server is also a client)
# This is useful when both WireGuard server and client have a public static IP
# The format is comma-separated list of <client_ip>:<client_port>:<forward_port>,
# where <client_ip> is the IP of the client, <client_port> is the UDP port of the client,
# and <forward_port> is the local UDP port used by connections to the server,
# e.g. UDP port to which the server should send packets.

# Maximum dummy length for data packets
# This is the maximum length of dummy data in bytes that can be added to data packets.
# This is used to obfuscate the traffic and make it harder to detect.
# The value must be between 0 and 1024.
# If set to 0, no dummy data will be added.
